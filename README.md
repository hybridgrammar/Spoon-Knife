### Well hello there!
WHO IS SOUNDBOY?
Soundboy is anyone or anything that breaks your signal flow. Soundboy dwells within the wrong adapter for your device, that traffic light that is taking too long or that person that stands between you and your immediate or long term goal.  Soundboy is the ghost in the machine.  In Raz Mesinai’s “Soundboy Manifesto” we follow a young Producer’s evolution within the world of sound and soundsystems.  This journey involves trials and tribulations faced by the modern DJ / Producer and also documents the presence of and battles with Soundboy along the way.
